# Traffic-Management-System

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Traffic Management System. It simulates traffic flow across different lanes, manages vehicle movement, and handles emergency vehicles. The system utilizes classes for authorization, traffic lanes, alerts, and vehicle management.

## Features
- **Authorization:** Allows users to register, login, and exit the simulation.
- **Traffic Lane Management:** Manages traffic flow, vehicle movement, and emergency vehicle handling.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Simulates traffic lights and changes their state based on the system's logic.
- **Challan Generation:** Generates e-challans for vehicles violating speed limits.

## Usage
To use the system:
1. Compile and run the C++ code.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to register, log in, and interact with the traffic simulation.
3. Update traffic data, start the simulation, and display generated e-challans.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Execute the compiled program to start the Traffic Management System.
3. Follow the menu options displayed to navigate through different functionalities.

## Note
- The system is designed for simulation purposes and doesn't interact with real traffic or databases.
- Some functionalities may need adjustments or integrations for real-world usage.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute enhancements or report any issues!
